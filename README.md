List of Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
|Machine Learning|A type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and statistical models to make decisions or predictions about data.|
|Unsupervised Machine Learning|An area of machine learning that finds interesting patterns in data.|
|Dimensionality Reduction |A type of unsupervised machine learning. This category generally applies to the following financial applications: Feature discernment, Structure discovery, Big data visualization|
|Clustering|A type of unsupervised machine learning. Generally applies to recommended systems, targeted marketing, customer segmentation|
|Customer Segmentation|Divides the potential customers of a particular market into discrete groups.|
|KMeans|The K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm that identifies clusters and that solves clustering business problems. Clusters consist of particular groups in data.|
|Elbow Method|Commonly used heuristic for determining the number of clusters in a dataset|
|PCA |Principal Component Analysis - reduces the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible. PCA is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set|
